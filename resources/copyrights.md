The most helpful piece of information you can provide is a URL or other reference to what you believe may be the source of the infringing text. Another method providing context of the a potential copyright infringement text or media, is by creating an [<mark style="color:blue;">**issue**</mark>](https://github.com/forgewiki/forgewiki/issues) where contributors can fully work the issue until it is resolved.
