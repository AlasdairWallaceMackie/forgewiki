# Welcome to Forge Wiki

First off, welcome to Forge Wiki. This wiki is dedicated to the in-game level editor for the Halo franchise called Forge.

Inside the wiki, you'll be filled with all of your Halo Forge knowledge and desires. Learn how to create your first forge map, learn how to design a custom gametype, or even script a mini game that you can share with the community for custom game nights.

This wiki will include all assets, canvases, scripting and all that relates to the editor. Be sure to follow along with tutorials that will range from basic to advanced.&#x20;
